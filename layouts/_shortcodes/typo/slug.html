  typo/slug: Short identifier or label in small caps (journalism/print term)

  In newspaper production, a "slug" is a short identifier—often in small caps—
  used to label sections, categories, or article types. Think of the small
  "OPINION" or "BREAKING" labels you see above headlines.

  Common names: label, tag, category marker, section identifier

  Visually: small caps with subtle letter-spacing, used inline to mark
  or categorize content without breaking the reading flow.

  Usage:
    {{< typo/slug >}}Opinion{{< /typo/slug >}}
    {{< typo/slug >}}Special Report{{< /typo/slug >}}

  Styles: assets/css/typography.css (.slug class)
