  typo/nutgraf: The "so what" paragraph explaining significance (journalism term)

  The "nut graf" (or "nut graph") is journalism's answer to "why should I care?"
  It's the paragraph that explains the story's broader meaning or relevance.
  Named because it contains the "nut" (core) of the story in a "graf" (paragraph).

  Common names: takeaway, significance paragraph, the point, thesis statement

  Visually: slightly emphasized block that stands out as the key insight
  or reflection the reader should take away. Often philosophical or summary-like.

  Usage:
    {{< typo/nutgraf >}}
    I'm sharing this project as part of my professional reflection
    as a future SPED teacher. Not because it was extraordinary,
    but because it was ordinary—and still so often withheld.
    {{< /typo/nutgraf >}}
