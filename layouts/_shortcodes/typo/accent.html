  typo/accent: Subtle inline emphasis (typography term)

  An "accent" in typography is a gentle stress on particular words—
  not as loud as bold or italic, but enough to guide the reader's eye.
  Think of it as a whisper of emphasis rather than a shout.

  Common names: highlight, soft emphasis, stress, quiet emphasis

  Visually: slightly different color and weight, used mid-sentence
  to draw attention without disrupting flow.

  Usage:
    {{< typo/accent >}}Inclusion doesn't always look big.{{< /typo/accent >}}
    Sometimes it's the small moments.

  Styles: assets/css/typography.css (.accent class)
