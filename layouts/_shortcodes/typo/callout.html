  typo/callout: Highlighted box drawing attention (journalism/design term)

  A "callout" is a visually distinct box or panel that pulls key information
  out of the main text flow. Newspapers use them for statistics, quotes,
  or crucial facts readers shouldn't miss.

  Common names: highlight box, feature box, inset, breakout box, fact box

  Visually: subtle background with border, slightly larger text,
  standing apart from body copy to catch the eye.

  Usage:
    {{< typo/callout >}}
    **Key finding:** 73% of students showed improvement
    after the intervention was implemented.
    {{< /typo/callout >}}

  Note: Markdown formatting (bold, italic, links) works inside.

  Styles: assets/css/typography.css (.callout class)
