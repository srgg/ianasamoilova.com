  typo/beat: Pause in narrative rhythm (journalism/screenwriting term)

  A "beat" is a moment of silence or pause in storytelling—borrowed from
  screenwriting where "(beat)" in a script means the actor pauses.
  In written narrative, it's visual breathing room between sections.

  Common names: pause, breath, break, section break, white space

  Visually: vertical margin that creates deliberate space between
  narrative sections, signaling a shift in tone or topic.

  Usage:
    ...end of one section.

    {{< typo/beat >}}

    Beginning of next section...

  Note: This is a self-closing shortcode (no inner content).

  Styles: assets/css/typography.css (.beat class)
