  typo/beat: Pause in narrative rhythm (journalism/screenwriting term)

  A "beat" is a moment of silence or pause in storytelling—borrowed from
  screenwriting where "(beat)" in a script means the actor pauses.
  In written narrative, it's visual breathing room between sections.

  Common names: pause, breath, break, section break, white space

  Visually: vertical margin that creates deliberate space between
  narrative sections, signaling a shift in tone or topic.

  Parameters:
    size: sm (1em), md (1.5em), lg (2em), xl (2.5em, default) - vertical spacing
    rule: true/left/center/right - horizontal separator line (typography term)
          true = full width (matches <hr> styling)
          left/center/right = positioned line with custom width
    width: line width (e.g., "3em", "50%") - only with positioned rules

  Usage:
    {{< typo/beat >}}                              (default xl = 2.5em, no line)
    {{< typo/beat size="md" >}}                    (medium spacing)
    {{< typo/beat rule >}}                         (full-width rule like <hr>)
    {{< typo/beat rule="center" width="3em" >}}    (centered 3em rule)
    {{< typo/beat size="sm" rule="left" width="2em" >}}  (small beat, left-aligned rule)

  Note: This is a self-closing shortcode (no inner content).
