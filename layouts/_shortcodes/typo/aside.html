  typo/aside: Reflective digression from the main narrative (journalism term)

  An "aside" is a moment where the author steps back from the story
  to offer a personal reflection, context, or parenthetical thought.
  It's related to the main content but stands slightly apart.

  Common names: side note, parenthetical, reflection, commentary

  Visually: subtle styling that signals "this is the author thinking aloud"
  without breaking the flow. Often used for personal insights or meta-commentary.

  Usage:
    {{< typo/aside >}}
    **That is how I understand special education:** not as a system
    that tries to make everyone the same, but as a space where
    differences are recognized—and allowed to belong.
    {{< /typo/aside >}}

  Note: Markdown formatting (bold, italic) works inside.

  Styles: assets/css/typography.css (.aside class)
