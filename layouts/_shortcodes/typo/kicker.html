  typo/kicker: Short intro line that sets up what follows (journalism term)

  In print journalism, a "kicker" is a brief line placed above or before
  a headline or paragraph to provide context or tease what's coming.
  Think of it as the conversational lead-in: "Here's the thing..."

  Common names: lead-in, intro line, setup phrase, teaser

  Visually: slightly larger, bolder text that introduces an important point
  without being a full heading. Often followed by a list, quote, or key statement.

  Usage:
    {{< typo/kicker >}}Hands tell stories before words do:{{< /typo/kicker >}}

  Styles: assets/css/typography.css (.kicker class)
