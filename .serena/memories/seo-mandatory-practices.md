# PARA Welcome Kit SEO & Content Strategy - Internal Guidance

Purpose: Provide clear guidance to content/SEO specialists on how to create, structure, and optimize all PARA Welcome Kit materials. This is internal reference only.

1. Structure & Style: 
- Always **lead with engaging media** (slides, videos, or images) to immediately hook the reader.
- Follow with **concise, emotionally resonant text** that explains practical value, relevance, and real-world impact.
- Use **scannable bullet points** for key strategies or tips.
- Include short, reflective sentences that speak **directly to paraeducators**, while also appealing to educators and administrators.
- Maintain **consistent voice across pages**: empathetic, encouraging, and authoritative.

2. Tone & Voice:
- Words to trigger connection: "supported," "confident," "valued," "inclusive," "practical," "companion," "human," "celebrate," "empower," "trusted."
- Highlight **challenges first**, then position the resource as **solution-oriented and empowering**.
- Avoid negative judgments about colleagues or institutions; focus on **systemic gaps and practical guidance**.

3. SEO Best Practices:
- **Primary keywords**: paraeducator, PARA Welcome Kit, practical guide, inclusive classroom, special education support.
- **Secondary keywords**: teacher assistant guidance, onboarding resource, new PARA support, inclusive teaching strategies.
- Include **internal links** to related blog posts, tutorials, and resources to increase dwell time and contextual relevance.
- Meta titles and descriptions should:
  - Include primary keywords early.
  - Be **concise, 120–160 characters** for descriptions.
  - Emphasize **benefits, outcomes, and practical use**.
- Headers (H1/H2/H3) should reflect both **keywords and user intent**.
- Use **alt text for all images/slides/videos** with descriptive, keyword-rich phrases.

4. Calls to Action (CTAs):
- Use **action-oriented, empathetic language**: “Explore,” “Swipe through,” “Share your feedback,” “Discover practical strategies.”
- Make **feedback CTAs specific** to improve the resource based on user experience.
- Avoid generic or vague CTAs; tie directly to PARA needs and real classroom scenarios.

5. Content Guidelines:
- **First-person reflections** are allowed to humanize content.
- Always frame examples or anecdotes in **solution-focused or educational terms**.
- Ensure text is **readable, 8th–10th grade level**, short paragraphs, and clear formatting.
- Keep **slides, visuals, or video upfront** for engagement and improved UX.
- End pages with a **clear action** (feedback, explore more resources, next steps).

6. Cross-Page Consistency:
- Titles, subtitles, and summaries should follow **the same style and tone** across all PARA Welcome Kit pages.
- All pages should **link to the main project hub** and related tutorials/resources for contextual SEO strength.
- Maintain a **consistent voice, keyword density, and structure** to reinforce branding and search relevance.
