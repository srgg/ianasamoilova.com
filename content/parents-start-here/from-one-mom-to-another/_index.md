This page holds a quiet kind of material. Not instructions. Not expectations. Not advice on how to “do things right.”

Inside, you’ll find a letter written from me—the mother of a daughter with autism to another mother, shaped by lived experience, careful listening, and care.

It was inspired by reading *Sincerely, Your Autistic Child*, by my experience as a parent of a child with autism, and by my work as a paraeducator in Special Education.

This is a space to pause, reflect, and listen: to autistic voices, to our children, and sometimes to ourselves.
You don’t need to read everything at once. Scroll, stop, return later—take what feels helpful and leave the rest.

If you are a parent, this letter is for you.
If you are an educator, this is a window into how family-facing communication can look when it is grounded in respect, dignity, and trust.

Take your time. Start anywhere.
