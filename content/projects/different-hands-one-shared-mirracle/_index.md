{{< typo/lede >}}Every year, schools host a holiday poster contest—one that the SPED department is usually expected to skip, not because students can't participate, but because it's assumed they shouldn't.{{< /typo/lede >}}

This year, I suggested a handprint-based art project from our SPED classroom.

The idea didn't come from a curriculum guide or a planning document. It came from everyday work with my students—from knowing how much they learn through movement, touch, and shared activity. Instead of designing something *for* them, we created something *with* them.

{{< typo/pull-quote >}}What mattered most wasn't the final poster. It was the **process**—hand by hand, moment by moment.{{< /typo/pull-quote >}}

We gently dipped students' hands into paint. One by one, they placed their handprints on paper. SPED role was simple:
cut, arrange, support when needed, and assemble the pieces into a single artwork.

It was sensory, playful, and deeply human. Students participated through motion and touch. Adults practiced stepping back. No one was rushed. No one was corrected into conformity.

At that moment, inclusion wasn't a policy or a statement. It was a choice—made repeatedly, hand by hand. And each handprint was different—size, pressure, shape, color—yet together, they formed something whole.

{{< typo/kicker >}}Hands tell stories before words do:{{< /typo/kicker >}}

{{< typo/verse >}}
They fidget, flap, hesitate, reach out, pull back...
They explore before they explain...
They communicate...
They learn...

And in SPED classrooms especially, hands are often where learning begins.

{{< typo/aside >}}**That is how I understand special education:** not as a system that tries to make everyone the same, but as a space where differences are recognized—and allowed to belong.{{< /typo/aside >}}

{{< typo/nutgraf >}}I'm sharing this project as part of my professional reflection as a future SPED teacher. Not because it was extraordinary, but because it was ordinary—and still so often withheld.{{< /typo/nutgraf >}}

{{< typo/accent >}}Inclusion doesn't always look big.{{< /typo/accent >}} Sometimes it looks like paint on small hands, time taken without urgency, and students trusted to participate.
