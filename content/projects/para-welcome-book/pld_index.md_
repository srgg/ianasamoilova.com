Starting as a paraeducator opened my eyes to a world of small victories, big challenges, and lessons no one warns you about.  
Here’s what I wish I had on day one — read more about my first months in the classroom in this [blog post about my early PARA experiences](/blog/para-welcome-book).

{{< spoiler text="Read more about the PARA Welcome Book..." >}}

PARAs are the quiet backbone of inclusive classrooms—present in every transition, every breakthrough, and every challenging moment. Yet most start without clear, practical guidance.

This book combines my hands-on experience as a District 11 SPED paraeducator with inclusive practices from my work and study. It's designed to be supportive, empowering, and deeply human—the resource I wish I had on day one.

Inside, you'll find guidance on everyday realities:

* Building trust with students
* Recognizing early signs of dysregulation
* Communicating with dignity
* Working as a team
* Practicing inclusive thinking
* Caring for yourself while supporting others

This is not a rulebook—it's a companion. Paraeducators deserve to feel prepared, valued, and respected. Whether you're a PARA, educator, or administrator, this book celebrates and illuminates the essential work you do every day.
