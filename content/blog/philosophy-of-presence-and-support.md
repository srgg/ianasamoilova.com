title: "Philosophy of Presence and Support: My Journey Into Special Education"
subtitle: 'True humanity is revealed in how we see and support those who are most vulnerable'
summary: |
    When I look back at the path that led me into special education, 
    I see more than a career choice — I see a story of compassion, resilience, and purpose. 
    My journey began far from Colorado Springs, USA, in the place where I was born: Ukraine.

### A First Encounter That Changed Everything
Years ago, my local quilting community in Ukraine invited me to volunteer at a state-run orphanage for girls with disabilities. The building itself was poor, surviving only through the passion of its director, 
a few devoted staff members, and the generosity of charity groups.

Before we entered the classroom, the teacher paused and asked us:
> Do you have experience with orphanage children? For these girls, the real goal is not the craft... it is your presence, your touch, your embrace.

That moment reshaped how I understood teaching. What mattered most wasn’t the activity we brought, but the love, dignity, and human connection we could offer.

### From Ukraine to Colorado
Today I live in Colorado Springs, working as a paraeducator in special education while completing my studies at [UCCS](https://coe.uccs.edu/academics/teaching-learning/special-education-added-endorsement-grad-cert) to become a SPED teacher. 
My heart belongs to children — to helping them feel safe, grow in confidence, and believe in themselves.

The contrast between my early experiences in Ukraine and [my SPED experience in the U.S.](/experience) has given me a unique perspective.
Resources and systems may look different, but the essence is the same: children with disabilities thrive when they are seen, valued, and supported.

### A Philosophy of Presence and Support
The idea of _dis/Ability_ speaks to me. A disability is not the absence of ability; it is a different way of engaging with the world. 
My role is to ensure that difference is not a barrier, but a pathway to growth.

I’ve also seen how what may be called a “limitation” in one area often unlocks unexpected strengths in another.
Some children demonstrate extraordinary creativity, empathy, or problem-solving skills precisely because they 
experience the world differently. History is full of examples of individuals who, despite challenges, 
reached genius levels in art, science, or innovation.

This reminds me that teaching is not about fixing deficits, but about discovering and nurturing hidden potential.

### Why I Chose SPED
For me, entering special education is not just a professional decision; it is a calling. The girls in that Ukrainian orphanage, the students I support today, and the many teachers and mentors who have inspired me — all of them remind me why this work matters.

Special education asks us to measure success not only in academic outcomes but in belonging, resilience, and hope. That is the kind of classroom I want to help build.

And yet, presence alone is not enough. The hand that comforts must sometimes join with the tool that empowers. Thoughtful use of technology can open doors that human touch alone cannot. I reflect on this balance in my companion piece, [Technology for Inclusive Learning: My Balanced Philosophy](/blog/balanced-approach-using-technology-in-education).
