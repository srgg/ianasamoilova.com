My first months as a paraeducator were an eye-opener. Like many new PARAs, I stepped into the role with heart—and while I had a strong academic background, nothing fully prepared me for the day-to-day realities of the job. Not because anyone lacked care, but because in busy Special Education classrooms, everyone is stretched thin, and there is rarely time for the kind of onboarding this work truly deserves.

Those first days and weeks were overwhelming. I wanted to support students well, yet much of the role felt like guesswork. I kept wishing there were one simple, welcoming resource—something that explained the essentials and helped new PARAs feel less alone as they navigated a steep learning curve.
