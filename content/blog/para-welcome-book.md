My first months as a paraeducator were eye-opening. Like so many new PARAs, I
stepped into the role with heart—and while I had a strong educational
background, nothing truly prepared me for the day-to-day realities of being a
PARA. Not because anyone lacked care, but because in busy Special Education
classrooms, everyone is stretched thin, and there’s rarely time for the deep
onboarding this work deserves.

Those first days and weeks were overwhelming. I wanted to support students
well, yet so much of the job felt like guesswork. I kept wishing there was one
simple, welcoming resource that explained the essentials and helped new PARAs
feel less alone in the steep learning curve.

That’s why I created *The PARA Welcome Book*—the book I needed on day one.
A warm, practical guide to help new paraeducators feel supported, confident,
and valued as they begin this challenging, meaningful work.
