I believe that technology in education should serve as a tool for empowerment, not a distraction or substitute for thinking.

After watching the TED Talk, {{< youtube jsRnow7Dnlg >}} I agreed with the speaker’s main idea: _we should focus not on the process of using technology itself, but on the actual learning outcomes students achieve through it_. At the same time, I reflect on the reality that games and gadgets trigger dopamine release. Just as dopamine addiction can make students dependent on screens, it can also reshape their worldview, shorten attention spans, and affect motivation for traditional learning.
**My vision is to transform this dependency into a learning advantage, guiding students to use technology purposefully and meaningfully.**

In my current work as a paraeducator in an elementary SPED classroom, I see technology as both a challenge and a powerful opportunity. For some of my students, digital devices are the only reliable source of engagement and motivation. For example, I work with one student who resists writing by hand but shows strong skills in navigating apps. Instead of fighting his attachment to gadgets, I envision teaching him keyboarding skills and the use of a stylus. This way, his natural attraction to technology can become a bridge to literacy and communication rather than a barrier.

I also believe that while we must embrace instructional technology, we cannot abandon essential human practices. Handwriting, for instance, has been shown to enhance memory, activate multiple regions of the brain, and strengthen fine motor skills. According to cognitive research, writing by hand supports deeper comprehension and critical thinking. Therefore, my approach combines digital fluency with analog skills—technology should expand, not replace, traditional practices.

Technology is not only critical for students but also for empowering teachers. Digital platforms can reduce the burden of paperwork, streamline lesson planning, and provide immediate access to student data and progress. For example:

- [**Google Classroom**](https://classroom.google.com) makes it easy to organize assignments, communicate with students, and share resources without the chaos of endless paper.

- [**Data dashboards**](https://www.tableau.com/dashboard/what-is-dashboard) allow teachers to track progress in real time and quickly identify where students need extra support.

- [**IEP tracking**](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/browse?search=iep%20tracker) applications simplify documenting goals and progress for students with disabilities, reducing the hours teachers typically spend writing reports.

- Assessment tools such as [**Kahoot!**](https://kahoot.com) not only save time but also provide instant feedback that shapes instruction.

These tools cut down on monotonous clerical work, minimize errors, and give teachers back their most precious resource: time for meaningful interaction with students.

One of the greatest barriers I observe is the slow and bureaucratic nature of school systems. While the world rapidly moves toward advanced neural technologies that could give a voice to nonverbal students, educators often struggle to obtain something as basic as a stylus or an adaptive keyboard from the district. This disconnect between technological progress and school policy is frustrating for teachers, students, and families.

To overcome this, I envision stronger advocacy: gathering data on student progress with technology, sharing success stories with administrators, and building collaborative networks of teachers who push for equitable access. By framing technology not as an extra privilege but as an essential accommodation, we can gradually shift district priorities toward responsiveness and innovation.

Technology is evolving faster than any curriculum can keep up with. To remain effective, I plan to commit to continuous professional development—exploring new tools, following educational research, and learning from both formal training and peer collaboration. More importantly, I believe that staying current means cultivating a flexible mindset: being open to innovation, willing to experiment, and reflective about whether each tool serves learning goals or distracts from them.

In short, my vision is **_a balanced approach_**: using technology to harness student motivation and engagement, while preserving the cognitive and social benefits of traditional skills such as handwriting and face-to-face communication. For students with disabilities, technology should not be a toy or an escape, but a carefully chosen tool that opens doors to independence, learning, and dignity. At the same time, for teachers, technology should be a partner—reducing routine paperwork and providing powerful insights—so that more energy can be directed to what truly matters: **_teaching, connection, and student success_**.
