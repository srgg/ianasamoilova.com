**Iana Samoilova** is an educator and paraeducator in Special Education, as well as a language specialist with a Master’s degree, based in Colorado Springs.

A native Ukrainian speaker fluent in Russian and English, Iana also teaches Ukrainian and is currently studying Spanish. Her strength lies in recognizing the unique needs of children with disabilities and tracing the cause-and-effect behind their behaviors. By creating a safe and supportive environment, she helps students feel understood and successful. She is known for thinking outside the box and designing flexible strategies that unlock each learner’s potential.

Iana embraces the idea that a difficulty in one area can be balanced—or even transformed—by strengths in another, sometimes leading to extraordinary achievements. This belief shapes her teaching philosophy, where dis/ability is understood as both challenge and possibility.

Beyond the classroom, Iana is a **cynologist and breeder**, a **professional pastry chef**, a **passionate quilter**, and a **licensed PADI Advanced Open Water diver**. She also holds a **brown belt in Aikido**. Her diverse skills reflect a lifelong commitment to creativity, discipline, and growth.

Bringing this same spirit into education, Iana integrates creativity, resilience, and cultural depth into everything she does—helping students and communities thrive.
